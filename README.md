# vanilla-tools
A simple mod that lets you disable vanilla tools and weapons.

## Branch structure
Each minecraft version has its own branch to not conflict with the build system's cache files.
Master will always be up-to-date with the current minecraft version (as of now, 1.12.2 -> 1.12 branch).
Legacy is the old branch that holded the old code for 1.10 and 1.11. There won't be support for those versions anymore.
