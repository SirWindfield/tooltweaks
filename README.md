# What are all the branches about?
I'm trying to make one branch for all minecraft versions that we can support. 
It will be helpful for us so we don't have to make strange stuff to backport!

To explain, all our sources will be inside one gradle main subproject and the "Bootstrap" subprojects 
will help us build the main subproject for each minecraft version without backporting everytime :D

**This branch is used for the older versions for now. I am (SirWindfield) currently trying to fix the bugs that are still occuring on 1.12 and wanted a clean environment for that.**
