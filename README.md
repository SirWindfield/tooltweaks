# Vanilla Tools
A simple mod that lets you disable vanilla tools and weapons but let use them as crafting items.

# What is branch all about ?
I'm trying to make one branch for all minecraft versions that we can support. 
It will be helpful for us so we don't have to make strange stuff to backport !

To explain, all our sources will be inside one gradle main subproject and the "Bootstrap" subprojects 
will help us to build that main subproject into each minecraft versions without backporting everytimes :D
