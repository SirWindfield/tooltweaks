# Vanilla Tools
A simple mod that lets you disable vanilla tools and weapons but lets you use them as crafting ingredients.

# What are all the branches about?
I'm trying to make one branch for all minecraft versions that we can support. 
It will be helpful for us so we don't have to make strange stuff to backport!

To explain, all our sources will be inside one gradle main subproject and the "Bootstrap" subprojects 
will help us build the main subproject for each minecraft version without backporting everytime :D
